# embassy-database-management-system

Purpose of database: 
Today, all countries are striving towards a more productive information society that could offer their citizens better digital services. Being “digital” 
and therefore dependent on information and communication technology (ICT). For that Reason ,when I decided to develop this system, I highly depend on 
information technology to perform nearly every need and services for citizens. Means that some essential registries, e.g. the visa, passports services,
and birth-data and marriage certificates. will improve and  update  from manual –paper based operations into an automation system .
